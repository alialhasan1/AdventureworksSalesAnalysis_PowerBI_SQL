# AdventureworksSalesAnalysis_PowerBI_SQL
This repository contains SQL scripts and Power BI reports that analyze sales data from the AdventureWorks database for the years 2019 to 2021.

The AdventureWorks database is a sample database provided by Microsoft, which contains sales and marketing data for a fictitious bike manufacturing company.

The SQL scripts in this repository retrieve and aggregate data from the AdventureWorks database to provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The scripts include queries that calculate sales by product, sales by region, sales by customer segment, and sales by date.

The Power BI dashboards in this repository visualize the sales data using charts, tables, and graphs. The reports include interactive features such as slicers and filters that allow users to explore the data in different ways. The dashboards also provide insights into top-selling products, customer demographics, and revenue by region.
